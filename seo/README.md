## SEO recommendations

- using proper tags markups
- accessibility
- mobile friendly
- logical site hierarchy
- links: rel=”nofollow”, meaningful text
- if page is restucturise should redirects to 301

A 301 redirect indicates to the search engines that a website or pages have permanently moved. When you use a 301 redirect, the search engines will transfer most of the original page’s link equity to the new page.

A 302 redirect, on the other hand, indicates that a page has moved temporarily. You might use this when you’re redesigning or updating your site, but you still want to keep the original page’s link equity.

- <meta rel=”canonical”> tag to indicate different pages and URLs are holding the same content.
- localization - to say browser about other language versions
- speed
